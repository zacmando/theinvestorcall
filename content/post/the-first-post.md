**The stock market crash of 1929** truly is the hallmark of financial failure at large. It is in most part a reality to fear, a reminder that good times do not always remain good. With the craze on the street and the ambinece of the roaring 20s', could anyone have guessed what would come? I think it tends to be that when we live in a certain paradigm those that recall to the past and man's ryhtm of nature, it becomes an attack on the mob. For Jesse Livermore, infamous speculator of the 20s', it would become more than a matter of finances in his pursuit against the crowd but rather one of life and death.
